# Survival-Quiz
Quiz to see how well you know how to survive in the wilderness

Goals of this application:

* create a timed multiple choice quiz where the user will get extra points taken off if they choose an incorrect answer

* when the game is over, the user gets the opportunity to save their score into local storage and see what scores others who previously played the game got.

* the user can clear the stored scores

## Description

* On the home page, the user can choose to either start a new game or view the saved scores depending on what button they push

* Upon clicking Start, the first question appears with different answer options. 

* When the user clicks an option, there is feedback at the bottom indicating whether the answer chosen was correct or incorrect.

* The next question is then displayed.  If the answer was wrong, extra time is subtracted from the timer.

* When either the timer runs out or the user answers all of the questions, the game is over.

* The user can then enter their initials and save their score to local storage.

* When they save their score, a new page is displayed which reads all of the saved scores from local storage.

* The user can then select a button to either Clear all of the saved scores or go back and take the quiz again.

* A countdown area displays the current seconds remaining.

* The UI is responsive and works at many different screen sizes

* a favicon was created and added so that the user can identify the quiz's tab.
